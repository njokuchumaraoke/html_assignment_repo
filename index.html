      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>
        As an only son, raised by my mother after my father&apos;s passing,
        I&apos;ve grown with a strong drive to support my family and make a
        meaningful impact. I&apos;m deeply passionate about technology, seeing
        it as a powerful tool for innovation and problem-solving. I constantly
        seek to improve myself, especially in front-end development, aiming to
        gain skills that can empower in my current career path and expose me to
        better opportunities. For me, technology isn&apos;t just a
        fieldâ€”it&apos;s a path toward self-growth and contributing to my
        community and country.

      <h2>My Journey</h2>
      <p>
        As a process automation engineer, I seek to merge my expertise with
        advanced front-end engineering skills to create user-friendly and
        globally accepted web applications. This pursuit aligns with my goal of
        solving real-world problems while providing financial support to my
        family amidst Nigeria's challenging economic landscape. My commitment to
        coding from scratch, rather than relying heavily on low-code tools,
        underscores my dedication to mastering the craft and developing
        scalable, robust solutions. By honing these skills, I aim to deliver
        impactful web applications that address both local and global needs,
        ensuring excellence in quality and innovation.
